#### About description from the webpage:
"Welcome to Matched.

Our goal is to increase connection among students at Brown. To form a new connection, all you have to do is specify your match type (study buddy, date, or friend), then fill out a quick questionnaire. We then use a natural language processing model, Cohere, to score the similarity between your answers to the questionnaire and others' answers. Our algorithm takes into account the similarity between each question equally and returns your top 3 matches!

When using Matched, keep in mind that meeting new people based on similarity isn't the only way. We encourage you to find many ways to meet new people, including ways that promote connections with people who have different interests than you do."

#### My contribution:
I worked on the frontend design and implementation. I used Figma to design the UI and built the frontend layout using MUI. I created each of the questionairre forms with validation using Formik. I implemented the handling of form submission and sent the parsed form response data to our backend API.
